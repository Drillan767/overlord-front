## Who I Am

I'm Joseph Levarato, a 32-year-old Full Stack Web Developer with over 7 years of building websites and applications. I work with Vue, Nuxt, Node.js, TypeScript, modern CSS frameworks, Laravel, and I enjoy working with DevOps tools whenever I can. This portfolio is where I showcase projects I've built and share articles about things I've learned (mostly so I don't forget them later).

## What Drives Me

There's nothing quite like watching someone use a tool you built and seeing that moment when they realise how much it actually helps them. That's the dopamine hit that keeps me coding. I think websites should be both gorgeous and functional  though what counts as "gorgeous" is obviously up to each person.

## What You'll Find Here

Projects that solve real problems, articles documenting my learning process, and hopefully some useful insights for fellow developers. I focus on clean code and performance because slow, broken things aren't beautiful no matter how they look.
