This is an old project for my good friend Geoffrey Turpin, a musician and composer and currently working as a sound designer.

He wanted a showcase site so he could easily be able to display the latest things he created. I rebuilt the website twice, the first time because it was built with Ruby on Rails, an excellent framework that I no longer work with, meaning I couldnâ€™t maintain it anymore. The second rebuild was because I realized nothing was dynamic and it honestly felt like a hassle to change anything.

So, the third (and current/last) version is easier to update, as I had a better understanding of PHP and Laravel in general: I could more easily create models that corresponded to its creations, articles, etc.

Geoffrey also asked me to create a simulation invoicing system: after inserting a few data such as the price per second for some types of music, he could easily be able to have an idea of what to bill to a potential client that wanted a music piece of a particular length and genre.

His wife, Sandra, provided the design and the general atmosphere.
